# Marketplace Technical Foundation 
(Rental Car E-commerce)

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly online platform that allows users to search for, book, and pay for car rentals. The system will cater to both customers and administrators, ensuring efficient management of rentals, user data, and reviews.

## Step 1: Technical Requirements Definition

### Frontend Requirements
- *Framework*: Use *Next.js* for server-side rendering and optimized performance.
- *Responsive Design*: Ensure the website is mobile-friendly using CSS frameworks like *Tailwind CSS* or *Bootstrap*.
- *User-Friendly Interfaces*:
  - Implement intuitive navigation with clear CTAs (Call to Action).
  - Use modals for login/signup to enhance user experience.

### Backend Requirements
- *Content Management System*: Utilize *Sanity CMS* for managing car listings, user data, and reviews.
- *Third-Party Integrations*:
  - Payment processing through APIs like *Stripe* or *PayPal*.
  - Shipment tracking (if applicable) through relevant APIs.

## Step 2: System Architecture Design

### High-Level Diagram
Create a diagram that illustrates the interactions between the components:
- *Frontend (Next.js)*: User interface handling requests and displaying data.
- *Backend (Sanity CMS)*: Manages data storage and retrieval.
- *APIs*: Handles payment processing and any additional third-party services.

### Example Workflows:
1. *User Registration*:
   - User submits registration form → Data sent to backend → Confirmation email sent.
2. *Product Browsing*:
   - User searches/filter cars → API fetches data from Sanity → Results displayed.
3. *Order Placement*:
   - User selects a car → Proceeds to payment → Payment processed via API → Confirmation displayed.

## Step 3: API Requirements Planning

### Define Endpoints
1. *GET /api/cars*: Retrieve a list of available cars with filters (type, price).
2. *GET /api/cars/:id*: Retrieve detailed information about a specific car.
3. *POST /api/rentals*: Create a new rental order with user details and car selection.
4. *POST /api/payments*: Process payment information securely.
5. *GET /api/reviews/:carId*: Fetch reviews for a specific car.

### Payloads and Responses
- Define request payloads for creating rentals and processing payments.
- Specify expected responses, including success messages and error handling.

## Step 4: Technical Documentation Writing

### Create Comprehensive Documents
1. *System Architecture Document*:
   - Include diagrams showing interactions between components.
   - Describe the purpose of each component in the architecture.

2. *API Specifications Document*:
   - Detail each endpoint, including methods, payloads, response formats, and examples.

3. *Data Schemas Document*:
   - Define schemas for entities such as cars, users, rentals, and reviews in Sanity CMS.

### Example API Documentation Snippet

#### GET /api/cars

**Description**

      "image": "url_to_image",
      "features": ["Automatic", "5 seats"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 5: Data Schemas Document

### Overview

## Business Model Considerations

Consider implementing a commission-based revenue model where fees are charged per rental. Additional fees may include delivery charges or subscription packages for frequent users. This approach can enhance revenue stability while providing value to customers.
